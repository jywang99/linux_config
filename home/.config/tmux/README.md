# Tmux configuration
**Prerequisite**: Make sure all [dotfiles](../../../README.md#dotfiles) are in place.

The configuration uses [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), which is a submodule of this repository.\
After making sure all dotfiles and TPM submodule are in place, run
```bash
tmux source ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
tmux
```
Then press `<M-m>I` to install plugins.
