# Linux Configs
My Linux configuration files and scripts.

## Dotfiles
My dotfiles are stored under `home` directory of this repository.\
Steps to apply dotfiles:
1. Install [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
2. Run make command
```bash
make user
```

## Other configs
These configs need additional steps to apply.
1. [tmux](home/.config/tmux/README.md)
2. [Arch packages](arch/README.md)
